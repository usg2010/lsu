            <p>It is imperative for the student in the transitional stage between high school and university to choose a
                major that will help him build his future and move into working life.
                We see some students tend to the literary section, which includes in depth the basics of languages ​​and
                the history of civilizations and laws, and some of them find themselves in the scientific section able
                to solve and understand difficult equations and combinations and dive into the sea of ​​science that
                contains research and theories not Finite. And between the two types, we find some students who are
                familiar with the previous two sections.
                From this standpoint, the university gives us many options and fields that work to enhance the
                tendencies of each student, highlight his abilities, and satisfy his passion.</p>
