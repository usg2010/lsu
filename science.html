                <h3>Physics</h3>
                <p>It is the science that studies basic concepts,
                    such as sound, light and motion, and it is the
                    science that attempts to understand the laws of
                    nature and the relationship between energy and matter.
                    Physics deals with particles to black holes and the
                    general structure of the universe. Mathematical formulas
                    are used to try to explain theories and make predictions.
